# SAT-Goat-TI84
## The SAT Goat app was develop by me for the TI-84 calculator. From what my students have said (I'm an SAT tutor), it's helped them a lot on the Calculator portion of the SAT; and yes, it's allowed!

# Installation Guide

# Usage/Examples
# Home: All Categories/Functions
## When you launch the app, you will be prompted with 6 different categories. Select whichever one applies to you, and it will redirect you to a new screen where you will be prompted for further information to be given an answer. Examples of each category can be found further below this section.

# Systems of Equations
## Here, you can solve systems of equations that are in the form:  
### $Ax + By = C$  
### $Dx + Ey = F$

# Factor Polynomials
## Here, you can factor polynomials. It will prompt you for some information of the polynomial such as the highest exponent (degree) and the coefficients. 
## Below are some various factored polynomials.

# Quadratics
## Here, you can find out a lot of information about quadratics, including coverting to vertex form (which happens to randomly appear on the SAT and people, including me forget how to do it). Choose which form of quadratic you are given and follow the prompts and, voila! You now know everything you need to know about that quadratic equation!
